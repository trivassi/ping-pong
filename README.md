## Description

_This website takes input from the user as a number and appends a list that counts up to the number that was inputted. However, for every number less or equal to the number inputted that is divisible by 3, 5 and 15, it will be replaced with a word, as described in the following specifications:_

* _The program doesn't let non-numerical characters into the form._
  * _Example Input: a_
  * _Example Output: not allowed

* _The program returns up to the number inputted a list of the same numbers if it is less than 3._
  * _Example Input: 2_
  * _Example Output: 1, 2_

* _The program returns in a list up to the number inputted but replaces any number that is divisible by 3 with the word "ping"_
  * _Example Input: 3_
  * _Example Output: 1, 2, ping_

* _The program returns in a list up to the number inputted but replaces any number that is divisible by 3 with the word "ping"_
  * _Example Input: 3_
  * _Example Output: 1, 2, ping_

* _The program returns in a list up to the number inputted but replaces any number that is divisible by 5 with the word "pong" while still keeping the rules from above_
  * _Example Input: 5_
  * _Example Output: 1, 2, ping, 4, pong_

* _The program returns in a list up to the number inputted but replaces any number that is divisible by 15 with the word "ping-pong" while still keeping the rules from above_
